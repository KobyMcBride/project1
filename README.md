# project1
First project. Inspired by the idea of creating a app that functions similarly to Tinder, but with a different goal. Match would allow couples to swipe left and right 
but instead of accepting/denying potential partners, it would be restuarents, or activites, places (like bars) etc. The goal is for match to be the go to app when
two+ people cannot make a decision on what they want to do, eat, etc. 

Match also doubles as a beginnner project for myself. At this time of writing (12/28/21) I'm intermediate with html, complete novice with css, and have not touched any 
real languages. I intend to use this project to actively apply any learning and skills and be able to analyze it in a tangible and measurable fashion.
